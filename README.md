# LINGUAVOICE

LinguaVoice is a voice application for Bixby which helps you easily translate words and phrases from English into Russian. The meanings of individual words come together with their pictures, definitions and examples of usage.

The Capsule utilizes [SkyEng API](https://dictionary.skyeng.ru/doc/api/external). for our capsule.

Here are the hints on how you can interact with LinguaVoice:
1. Translate spring.
2. How do I say last but not least in Russian?
3. What is the word for goodbye in Russian?

The Capsule has **2 basic features**: 
* **searching for translation of an unknown word in a dictionary**
* **searching for a particular meaning of a word**
